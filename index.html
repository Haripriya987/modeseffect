        <p>You know we had to talk about blog posts first. For many brands, blog posts make up the central part of their content marketing strategy. There’s a good reason for this: blog posts typically don’t take too long to write, they’re easily found by Google, users are happy to read and share them, and it’s a quick way to offer value at a relatively low cost.

            different types of content
            Blog posts are ideal for building relationships with your readers, which can eventually help with lead nurturing and conversions. Maintaining a consistent blog with frequent, high-quality posts (like AdEspresso does) can also help drive significant amounts of traffic to the site.
             Because blogging is the most accessible type of content marketing, this is also the type of content that has the most potential traps brands fall into.
             The most common mistakes you want to avoid are:
            Not posting regularly. This can get you out of the habit and losing readers. Also, remember to regularly update your top ranking post.
